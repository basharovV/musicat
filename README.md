## Introduction

This is a player that I built for personal use, with the goal of re-connecting with my local music library in the age of streaming. It's pleasant to use, with a modern UX that is fresh yet feels familiar to classic software like Winamp, foobar2000 and iTunes. It's fast, audiophile-friendly and can handle large libraries of all formats. I wanted to create a tool that puts me as the listener back in the driver's seat, taking an active role in organizing and enriching my library of music that I curate with passion.

## For melomaniacs

Musicat also strives to be a meta-layer on top of your library. Features like Map View and Stats are all derived from the question - _"how can I connect more with my music collection?"_. They might seem like gimmicks, but there is a lot of room to explore this idea, and this app is the perfect playground to do that. Whether it's learning about the artists via a Wikipedia panel, or getting a glimpse into your listening habits, you can expect more functionality of this sort to be built into the app.

## For artists & musicians

As a musician, I also wanted to organize my own music that I've made over the years, or tag bands that I've played in, and use the app as a way to build your own discography, as well as a knowledge base of new song ideas and lyrics. I created a prototype feature called "Artist's Toolkit" (enable in Settings) that captures this idea. It's half-baked at the moment, but it has already proven useful as a concept.


## Features in progress
There's a lot of things in my personal wishlist, but here are the things that I'm working on or thinking about currently: 

🌐 **Internationalization**
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;●●●●●○○○○○</small>
</br>
<small>Once done, contributors can add new languages by adding a locale file eg. `src/i18n/it/index.ts`.</small>

🎨 **Theme Support**
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;●●●●●●●●○○</small>
</br>
<small>[→ See built-in themes and discuss here](https://github.com/basharovV/musicat/discussions/15)</small>

📖 **Knowledge/Wiki panel**
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;●●●○○○○○○○</small>
</br>
<small>A built-in Wikipedia reader for artists/albums/songs which makes interesting connections to your library.</small>

📖 **Linux/Windows builds**
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;●○○○○○○○○○</small>
</br>
<small>via Tauri's Github action</small>

📖 **Auto-updates**
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○○○○○○○○○○</small>
</br>
<small>Need to see how to do this with Tauri and Github releases</small>
