### ðŸ“¦ 0.11.0

_BREAKING RELEASE_.The app identifier has changed, please re-import your library after installation.

- **M4A format support** thanks to [@daiyam](https://github.com/daiyam).
- **Even faster library scrolling**. Scrolling the library (especially using the new scrollbar in a library with thousands of tracks) should be significantly faster due to reduction in memory allocation per scroll event.
